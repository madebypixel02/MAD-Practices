## 1. Login Screen

### a. `onViewCreated`

The code sets up an observer to watch for changes in a login and perform actions depending on the result of said login. If the result of the login (`loginResult`) is null, nothing is done. Otherwise, the progress bar is hidden and we check the status of the login result. If it has had an error, a message is shown. If the login is successful, the UI is updated with the user's info, a message is shown saying "`Login OK`" and the user's id is updated with the `loginOK()` method to match the new user's id.

### b. `setOnClickListener`

The code here listens for when the `login` button is clicked, and sets the progress bar to be visible, as well as attempts to log in with the entered username and password. It is inside a Fragment class because it allows the code inside to be more encpsulated and self-contained within an app, separate from an activity.

### c. `DataSourceHardcode`

```kotlin
user_harcoded = if (username == "user1@uoc.com") {
    User(1, "Jane Doe")
} else {
    User(2, "John Doe")
}
```
